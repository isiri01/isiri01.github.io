Hello everyone! Iâ€™m Isiri, a third-year undergraduate at the University of Moratuwa, where I am pursuing a degree in Biomedical Engineering.

I am currently working as a mentor and content creator at [RoboticGen Academy](https://roboticgenacademy.com/), where I am helping to create future tech leaders.

In addition, I am an active member of the University of Moratuwa IEEE EMBS Student Branch. And also I am an inducted member at the Rotaract Club of University of Moratuwa.

My passions lie in the fields of medical imaging and computer vision. Additionally, I have recently developed an interest in computational neuroscience and am eager to delve into this intriguing field and learn more about its applications and advancements.

In my free time, I like watching movies, specially psychological thrillers. And I enjoy playing piano and singing songs.
