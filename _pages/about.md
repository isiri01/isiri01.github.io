Hello everyone! I'm Isiri , a third year undergraduate at University of Moratuwa studying Biomedical Engineering. 

I work as a mentor and a content creator at [RoboticGen Academy](https://roboticgenacademy.com/)

I am an active member at University of Moratuwa IEEE EMBS Student Branch.

My passionate lies in the fields of medical imaging, computer vision and I am looking forward to explore the fascinating realm of computational neuroscience.

In my free time I like to watch movies specially phsychological thrillers.
